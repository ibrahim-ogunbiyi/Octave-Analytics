# Business Problem
CLIFE Resort is the owner of several five-star hotels in Nigeria. They've been in the hospitality business for 20 years. CLIFE is losing market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels sector as a result of strategic actions by competitors and ineffective decision-making by management. CLIFE's managing director desired to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" as a strategic step in order to reclaim market share and income. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics staff to deliver these insights.
Their revenue management team had decided to hire a third-party service provider to deliver insights based on past data.
